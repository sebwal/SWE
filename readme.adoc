We use three package managers in this project: npm, bower and tsd. Each has a .json file for config - npm --> package.json, bower --> bower.json, tsd --> tsd.json, and a folder for the packages - npm --> npm_modules, bower --> bower_components, tsd --> typings.
To get all our required packages, open command prompt and execute ">npm install -g bower tsd" to install bower and tsd (node has to be installed, environment variables have to be set),
and then execute ">npm install", ">bower install" and ">tsd update -so".
This will download all packages specified in the .json files.

When a .ts file is changed or created, open command prompt, navigate to the project's root folder and execute
  >npm run compile
This will generate (and overwrite) the app.js file corresponding to the .ts files referenced in _all.ts;
If a .ts file is created, it has to be added to _all.ts (this will make the new class available in the other .ts classes and, as mentioned above, generate the ES code in app.js)

We also use the task runner gulp - to test our code, execute >gulp in the command prompt. This will run all tasks specified in gulpfile.js, such as uglify the app.js, start the webserver on port 1337, and whatever there is to come.
