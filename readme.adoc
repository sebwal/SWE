We use three package managers in this project: npm, bower and tsd. Each has a .json file for config - npm --> package.json, bower --> bower.json, tsd --> tsd.json, and a folder for the packages - npm --> npm_modules, bower --> bower_components, tsd --> typings.
To get all our required packages, open command prompt and execute ">npm install -g bower tsd" to install bower and tsd (node has to be installed, environment variables have to be set),
and then execute ">npm install", ">bower install" and ">tsd update -so".
This will download all packages specified in the .json files.

When a .ts file is changed or created, open command prompt, navigate to the project's root folder and execute
  >npm run compile
This will generate (and overwrite) the app.js file corresponding to the .ts files referenced in _all.ts;
If a .ts file is created, it has to be added to _all.ts (this will make the new class available in the other .ts classes and, as mentioned above, generate the ES code in app.js)

To open the view (index.html), open command prompt, ... (exactly as above), and execute
  >npm run webserver
This will start the webserver, running on port 1337.

To add a new shortcut for the command prompt, add a new key/value pair to the scripts attribute in package.json, value being the line which would be typed in the command prompt.
  Usage: >npm run -key-
