##Package Managers
#### We use three package managers in this project: npm, bower and tsd. Each has a .json file for config  

* npm -> package.json  
* bower -> bower.json 
* tsd -> tsd.json

#### and a folder for the packages

* npm -> npm_modules 
* bower -> bower_components 
* tsd -> typings.

## Get required Packages

To get all our required packages, open command prompt and execute 

>npm install -g bower tsd

to install bower and tsd (node has to be installed, environment variables have to be set), and then execute 

* >npm install 
* >bower install
* >tsd update -so

This will download all packages specified in the .json files.

## Adding .ts files to the project

If a .ts file is created, it has to be added to _all.ts (this will make the new class available in the other .ts classes and it is needed to generate the ES code in app.js)

## Gulp

We also use the (totally awesome! :) ) task runner gulp. Run 

>gulp

in command prompt (navigate to our project root folder first), this will run all tasks specified in gulpfile.js, for example: 

* compile/transpile the .ts files and uglify the outcoming app.js file
* start the webserver running on port 1337.
